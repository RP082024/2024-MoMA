                    <p class="enlarge-text">In 2019 the Museum of
                        Modern Art (MoMA)
                        closed
                        its doors for four
                        months to
                        address its lack of
                        diversity and representation of artists of different genders and nationalities
                        within their works on view. <br>
                        <br>
                        After the reopening, Jason Farago describes in the New York Times how putting Picasso and Monet
                        next
                        to more
                        recent, diverse artists
                        changed the MoMA experience.

                    <h2>But did the acquisition practice change as well?</h2>
                    <p>This study wants to determine whether the acquisition policy of the MoMA changed
                        during the last five years.<br>
                        It will also compare the diversity of the current exhibition with the entire museum
                        collection
                        to see if the selections show measurable differences. <br>
                        <br>
                        For this purpose diversity measures, as they are widely used in ecology, are
                        transferred to
                        the cultural

                                        <p>Barr proposed selling works more than fifty years old to other museums as

                                            This radical approach was never implemented and is softened by the
                                            declaration, that modernity is still an ongoing process.<br>

                                    displayed was by women, and even less

                                    artworks at costs as were typical at the time of their creation, and it means to

                    <h4>From Everyday Notion to Rigorous Statistical Measure</h4>
                    <p>In conversational contexts, we often colloquially refer to diversity when we want to express that
                        the community in
                        question is not uniform. <br>However, uniformity can apply to a variety of aspects. <br>
                        <br>For
                        instance, we
                        might describe a
                        workplace as diverse if its members come from several different countries, even though they may
                        all be young. Similarly, we might call a club diverse if its members span a wide range of
                        professions,
                        overlooking the fact that all are white men.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Diversity depends on the viewpoint and on specific characteristics that are relevant to a
                            certain community at a

                    <p>According to Ann Magurran (1988) the <b>Shannon Index of Diversity</b> is one of the most widely
                        used
                        information theory indices. <br>In ecology most often the diversity of species is measured,
                        while
                        both the number of species (also known as <i><b>species richness</b></i>) and the
                        <i><b>relative

                        individuals belonging to each species) are considered equally.

                            Although still
                            somewhat cluttered, it avoids the traditional 'wall-of-text'
                            approach by
                            featuring a
                            billboard-like title. <br>
                            This title
                            quickly informs passers-by about the research topic, methods, and findings,
                            enabling
                            them to
                            decide in under five seconds if this research relates to their own
                            research
                            interests and shall be investigated further.<br></p>
